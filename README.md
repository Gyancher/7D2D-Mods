# 7D2D-Mods
New to the coding and mod designing with UNITY for 7 Days to Die, looking to find out how to activate code/animations with models in 7 days to Die. When thats done, then I can push out multiple new items like the Parking Rotator, Slide Doors, and more...

Mods,Code,3D Models,Etc

Feel free to use any of my codes that I modified from other GREAT WONDERFULL CODERS, I am just making the game more fun with new items to play with in the game.

If you see some code somewhere I should not use because itÂ´s private/yours, please let me know so I can take it out or add credits in the config files to you.
